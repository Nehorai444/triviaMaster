Hey evereybody,
I hope you will enjoy from this project.

To run the project you need do few steps:
1. Open terminal and put "npm i express mongoose crypto uuid body-parser"(make sure that you on the root directory of this project).
2. Copy the connection string from your mongoDB and put it on server.js under the variable "URL".
3. Open "mern" directory and run in terminal "npm run build".

That's all:)
